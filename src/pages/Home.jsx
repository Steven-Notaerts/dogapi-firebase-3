          Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural
          wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been
          bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be
          domesticated. ... They are a popular pet because they are usually
          playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans.
